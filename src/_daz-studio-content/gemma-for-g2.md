Gemma is an upcoming character for [Olympia 6](http://www.daz3d.com/olympia-for-genesis-2-female).

At the moment both the body and the head shape are completed. The textures (skin, makeup and eyes)
are in development. After those shaders will be implemented for 3Delight, Iray and Reality for Daz Studio.

The ultimate goal is to have a character preset in order to be sold at [Renderosity](https://www.renderosity.com/?AID=4909)
using Olympia 6 as a base for sculpting. 

*Current Status*: In development. Shape is now completed.

As soon as the textures and the shaders are completed a beta-test program will launch.
