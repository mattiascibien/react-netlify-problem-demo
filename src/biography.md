## Life

I was born in Belluno, Italy, on the 8th of May 1990. Since young age I have
always been interested in technology, either being something pretty simple or
complex like a computer.

I like to think that my passion for technology in general began when I started 
making games with Game Maker when I was twelve. The first "game" I made was an Arkanoid clone done
in half an hour featuring a diamond as a ball and one brick only.
In the following months I actually made quite a lot of things (unfortunately lost
due to a hardware failure), which then actually led me into the wonderful world of programming.

On the first year of high school I got introduced by a friend to Visual Basic 6.0
and on the next year I moved to Visual Basic .NET 2005 and C# 2.0, thanks to the
wonderful Visual Studio Express Editions. During these years I studies Turbo Pascal
at school and C++ at home.

After making a lot of prototypes in various programming languages I ended up working
on a simple Operating System that wrote a string on video (I never managed to
move into keyboard input) which I still had on a floppy disk written in C++
with a Rake build system.

I then moved to study computer science at the University of Udine. During these
three years I enjoyed doing a lot of programming and teamwork in particoular. I
made a clone of Trivial Pursuit in XNA with some friends and started to work on 
some open source projects. During this years I also met my girlfirend who is
also a programmer.

After graduating in March 2013 I moved to Milan to work for [Avanade](http://www.avanade.com/it-it/home) 
where I stayed until March 2015 when I got hired by [FastCode](http://www.fastcode.it/).

On the 20th June 2015 I married the love of my life, which I am proud to call "my
wife".

## Projects and Contributions

Besides being a full-time programmer I still enjoy doing some personal projects
and contribute to the open-source world.

Some of my contributions are featured in:

 * [ZLib.Portable](https://github.com/advancedrei/Zlib.Portable)
 * [RogueSharp](https://roguesharp.wordpress.com/)
 * [MonoGame](http://www.monogame.net/)
 * [Ghost](https://ghost.org/)
 * [QupZilla](http://www.qupzilla.com/) 
 * and [more](https://github.com/mattiascibien)

I also gained interest in 3D art which is still my favourite hobby.

Head over to the [Projects](/projects) page to see what I am doing and what I 
have one or check the [Gallery](/gallery) to see my works of art. The 
[DAZ Studio Content](/daz-studio-content) page, also, holds some of my works 
compatible with [Daz Studio](http://www.daz3d.com/daz_studio).
