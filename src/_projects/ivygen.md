Ivygen is a fork of [Ivy Generator](http://graphics.uni-konstanz.de/~luft/ivy_generator/) by Thomas Luft,
aimed at providing a stable and maintained fork with better code and performance.

### Features

In addition to the features provided by the original project, this are the changes
included in the fork:

 * Port to Qt5, improving compatibility with modern systems
 * Usability improvements including an updated and customizeable User Interface
 * Improvements on the rendering code including the possibility to remove triangles facing away and wireframing
 * There is no need to triangulate the models you import anymore

### Current Status

The project code is fairly stable and usable. Documentation on how to hack on the source code
are available in the [docs website](http://ivygen.readthedocs.org).

### Downloads

You will need a program capable of opening 7z archives like [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to install the software. If needed run `vcredist.exe` inside
the archive to install the runtime libraries.
