At the moment I am working on a game for PC (Windows) in the prototype phase.

During this phase I am going to try out different engines, [Unreal](http://unrealengine.com) 
and [Unity3D](https://unity3d.com/) in the first place, to find out which suits
my needs in the game.

I am not going to provide much details at the moment except that it is going to 
be a puzzle game with a unique twist (I hope that has not been done before).

Stay tuned for more news.
