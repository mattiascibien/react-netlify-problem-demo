[3drenderbot](http://twitter.com/3drenderbot) is a [Twitter](http://twitter.com) robot that retweets everything
related to the world of 3d rendering, modeling and animation.

Its source is available on Github under the name of [Oscar](https://github.com/mattiascibien/oscar), which
aims to be a generic retweet bot written in Ruby.

The bot at the moment is running under the [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) cloud and it is in beta stage
so expect downtimes.

If you wish to try it try to use the hastags `#daz3dart, #3drenderbot, #3dmodeling, #3danimation, #3drendering`.
If you think that I missed some do not hesitate to contact me and we will discuss the inclusion; you can also
fork the project on Github.
