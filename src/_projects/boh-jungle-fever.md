Boh! Jungle Fever is a Windows 8 game made with Construct 2 originally for the
[Scirra Windows 8 Game Competition](https://www.scirra.com/blog/104/new-windows-8-game-competition).

While it did not get between the first positions it has been donwloaded more
than a thousand times from the Windows Store.

### Features

 * Platform game with strategic events
    * Drop bombs that explodes at your will
    * Increasing difficulty (faster enemies)
 * Downloadable soundtrack ([Souncloud](https://soundcloud.com/jdbastardy/boh-jungle-fever-theme))
 * Scores are shared across your Windows device

### Planned features

 * More levels (and ambiencies)
 * More platforms (Windows Phone)
 * Social Features
 * Online leaderboards
 * More bombs
 * More enemies

### Current Status

Unfortunately due to the lack of interest by the public (there are still no reviews
on the store after almost two years) and the amount of work required to fix the
minor bugs present in the game the project is now discontinued. I originally wanted to
make it avaialble again using [Game Maker Studio](http://www.yoyogames.com/studio)
but in the last year I completely abandoned the project. Anyway, gameplay elements
are cool if elaborated in a new way so probably there is a possibility of a 
spiritural successor.
