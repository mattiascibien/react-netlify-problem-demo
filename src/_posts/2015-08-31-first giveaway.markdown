Hello, my fellow readers. As a matter of celebration for the new website,
I made a giveaway for a fantastic piece of software in collaboration with 
the italian videogame gameplay channel [Simon & Simon, two different views on the videogames world](https://www.youtube.com/user/arrafatsim1).

> **Note**: the giveaway is now over. The winner is Ermanno Giuliano.
> Stay tuned for more content in the future.

As I am a passionate indie videogame developer the prize of the first giveaway
is, guess what, a [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) copy of one of the easiest tools to make games: 
[Axis Game Factory](http://store.steampowered.com/app/352111/).
Moreover, it is not simply the base pack; it is the full premium version with another addition: 
the nice [Voxel Sculpt DLC](http://store.steampowered.com/app/352111/).

Axis Game Factory is a wonderful set of tools aimed at creating 3D games easily including
a level editor for rapid creation of your game's worlds with terrain and vegetation
editing with realistic (or not, you decide) lighting and atmosphere system.

With over a thousand of included assets, pre-set themes and sample maps you are 
not left alone learning the tools and you can start creating your dream world in 
a matter of minutes. Moreover, you can import your assets directly in the engine to 
play with them.

With the premium addon (included in the prize) you will also get interop with 
the wonderful [Unity 5](http://unity3d.com), so you can export your creations into it, and more than 500
of assets that can be used without restrictions and the ability to import and
export your terraing heightmaps. 

The DLC included also is an addon tool that lets you sculpt your terrain using 
voxels, a funnier and easier way to sculpt terrains.
