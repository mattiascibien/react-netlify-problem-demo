After a lot of time with my fellow laptop, I decided to do a massive upgrade to 
my hobby system and bought a new Desktop.

As my readers know, I actually work as an IT consultant and programmer in Milan
and fortunately my employer issues laptops for all the employes. Moreover as I 
am not travelling from home to university I was not needing a laptop anymore.
Moreover, video cards on laptops are very limited in CUDA Cores, which are very
important with NVIDIA Iray rendering.

These are the main reasons I decided to go for desktop along the fact that the 
price for a cool desktop is far lower than a same power laptop. I actually went 
for a custom assembled pc from [PC Specialist](https://www.pcspecialist.co.uk).

The order went fine and I received my PC in 15 days at my wife's office as it is
easier to reach by car than mine (and travelling with a box like that in the Metro
was not an option) as it included both the tower and the monitor.

Here are the spec of the computer:

I actually bought the SSD originally for the laptop  but thanks to 
<a href="http://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B00GYZRGIE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=3370&creative=24114&creativeASIN=B00GYZRGIE&linkCode=as2&tag=mattcibi-21">this adapter</a>
and a lot of help from my wife, as my clunky hands were not able to reach the inners of the drive bays, I was able to add
it to my new machine. Here is a photo of my new setup.

The first test was running [Skyrim](http://www.elderscrolls.com/skyrim/). The game set the optimal setting at Maximum with HD resolution (8x AA and 16x AF)
and I did not notice a single frame drop while registering a video of me playing (using
NVIDIA ShadowPlay).

After testing it I tried to run [DAZ Studio](daz3d.com/) which was handled without any problems
and did a 1000x1000 Iray render of a portrait in only 15 minutes using both my 
processor and video card. A great improvement over the 2 hours I needed before (for a 500px image).

Third test was checking out [Reality 4.1](http://preta3d.com/). I actually reached 120spp (samples per pixel)
just 5 minutes; this means that for reaching a decent quality image (1000spp)
in under one hour. This is a benefit of the new Reality update added with my new machine.
Unfortunately, I did not notice much improvements with using video card rendering
but I will look further into it.

The last test was making it run [ArmA 2](http://www.arma2.com/) which is a game I wished to play decently
for quite some time and the result is actually outstanding. HD resolution with 
nice graphics and a good rendering distance.

That's quite a big improvement, at least for me. I can start to learn the
Unreal Engine without my computer burning, use some of the 
game development tools I bought and, thanks to the reduced rendering times, 
I can focus on improving the quality of my images ohter than making them bigger.

I guess that from now on we can expect very big things from me.
