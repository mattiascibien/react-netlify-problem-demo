I did it again. Everything has been thrown in the trash and I started all over. You may think that I like this, but in fact this time it is not something that I wanted at all. 

I was trying to upgrade [Ghost](http://www.ghost.org) to the latest version when the inevitable happened: I deleted the database of the old blog, leading to the loss of all of the words I have written in these months.

So here I am, back again with a new blog still based on Ghost (this time with a [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com) database), ready to kick in. Hope you will continue to follow my journey on the Internet.

As a post scriptum I want to tell you, my readers, that the problem was not casued by the Ghost update process. __It was my fault__. Ghost is still a fantastic blogging platform and I absolutely suggest you to use it.
