In this post I am going to introduce my new series of renders that is going live
in the next days (weeks maybe): **Studio Shoots**.

As you see, I am alive and kicking, even if I have not been posting for quite some
time. I really hoped not to say this sentence anymore but, as you know, life 
sometimes kicks in and therefore you have to face quite a few interesting 
challenges.

I have been pretty quiet on deviantart since posting both 
[Purity](http://mattiascibien.deviantart.com/art/Purity-578567162) and
[Purity (Portrait)](http://mattiascibien.deviantart.com/art/Purity-Portrait-578714055),
except for a test render of [Olympia 6 HD](http://mattiascibien.deviantart.com/art/Olympia-6-Hd-589032499)
which was more than a simple test. During these days I have actually spent 
some money on new content by DAZ3D and external vendors, but I did not had much 
time to test the products I bought. In fact, as you have seen on my [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/mattiascibienweb/)
I have put my hands on some (and the post embedded here does not even list them all) Genesis 3 Characters.

<div class="text-center">
<div id="fb-root"></div><script>(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script><div class="fb-post" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/mattiascibienweb/posts/922225071206874:0" data-width="500"><div class="fb-xfbml-parse-ignore"><blockquote cite="https://www.facebook.com/mattiascibienweb/posts/922225071206874:0"><p>New library additions.</p>Pubblicato da <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mattiascibienweb/">Mattias Cibien Web</a> su&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/mattiascibienweb/posts/922225071206874:0">Mar. 16 Feb 2016</a></blockquote></div></div>

Unfortunately, with the new Generation 7, DAZ3D made quite some changes and it
seems that my renders does not come out as I expect so I decided that it is time
to reinvest in learning back everything.

Without further ado, I therefore announce my new render series: **Studio Shoots**.

**Studio Shoots** will feature images of girls (and maybe boys, I am still not sure)
posing like in a photoshoot made in studio. For this particoular type of setting
environment is mostly completely ignored so you should not expect detailed 
environments but plain backgrounds with very few props.

I have decided to do this primarly because I want to focus on improving skills 
in areas I do not have much experience including skin rendering, cloth rendering,
lighting and post-process. Removing background details will actually improve 
render times so I can focus in tweaking the details of the main figure itself
rather than focusing on having a pleasent backdrop. Unfortunately I guess that most
of the renders of this series will look quite similar but this will make everything
more challenging as I try to achieve some variations.

Alongside the new Generation 7 figures, I am going to use a bunch of nice products
I have collected over these months including the [IDG Easy Iray Studio](http://www.daz3d.com/idg-easy-iray-studio)
which have a very nice neutral background and a wonderful light rig and 
[Ultra Genesis Studio Vol 1](http://www.daz3d.com/ultra-genesis-studio-vol-1-iray-box-lights)
which almost has the same sets of features. I will also look into more interesting
light setups by checking the free corner and try to follow some professional 
guides on how to do a photoshoot like [this](http://www.digitalcameraworld.com/2012/05/02/54-portrait-ideas-free-downloadable-posing-guide/).

Alongside the renders I will also try to include a short blog post describing the
process I followed and the difficulties I have encountered. 

Hope you will like this new render series. Mattias Out.

P.S: I may also try to sneak in a Victoria 4 render maybe as I still have some
nice content I'd love to use.
